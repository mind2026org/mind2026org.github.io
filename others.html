                This talk explores the evolving landscape of large language models (LLMs) through the lens of brain-inspired intelligence, highlighting the critical gaps between current approaches and the efficiency, adaptability, and reasoning capabilities of the human brains. Key differentiating innovations include energy-efficient spiking neural networks, brain-inspired linear attention mechanisms enabling long-range sequence processing, and hippocampus inspired retrieval-augmented generation. We briefly touch on the importance of symbolic reasoning; whereby new learning approaches are required to reconcile how continuous neural activities may give rise to discrete concepts—a mark of human-level intelligence. Applications such as the brain-inspired medical LLM was presented. Finally, we outline future directions emphasizing the co-design of hardware, software, and algorithms to realize human-level embodied intelligence, which is capable of logical reasoning, active perception, and social cognition. We hope to inspire more collaborative efforts in bridging AI with neuroscience to forge next-generation intelligent machines.

              <div style="margin-top: 10px;">
                The brain is a dynamic system, characterized by intricate spatiotemporal dynamics that underpin cognitive functions and behaviors. However, the explicit formula and mechanism of this dynamic system remain elusive, thus necessitating the construction of brain dynamics models and the resolution of the inverse problem. In this talk, I will first present a data-driven approach from a self-supervised learning perspective. This approach involves training an artificial intelligence (AI) model to learn the dynamics of the brain by predicting the future from the past. The trained AI model serves as a surrogate brain. By conducting virtual perturbation experiments on this surrogate brain, we can obtain a whole-brain effective connectome. This effective connectome reflects the intensity, directionality, and excitatory-inhibitory characteristics of the brain's information flow, as well as the causal relationships between different brain regions. It thereby provides guidance for the selection of brain region targets in neuromodulation. Furthermore, I will introduce a surrogate brain-guided optimal control framework for controlling biological neural dynamics. We have validated this framework through experiments on in vitro neurons, which suggest that the closed-loop electrical stimulation designed with our framework can effectively achieve the control goals. Our framework paves new ways for the personalized treatment of brain diseases, the enhancement of brain functions, and the regulation of behavior.

                  Human Motor Cortex Encodes Complex Handwriting Through a Sequence of Stable Neural States

              <div style="margin-top: 10px;">
                How the human motor cortex (MC) orchestrates sophisticated sequences of fine movements such as handwriting remains a puzzle. Here, we investigate this question through Utah array recordings from human MC during imagined handwriting of Chinese characters. We find that MC programs the writing of complicated characters by sequencing a small set of stable neural states, which control the writing of a fragment of a stroke. By building models that can automatically infer the primitive states and implement state-dependent directional tuning, we can significantly better explain the firing pattern of individual neurons, and reconstruct recognizable handwriting trajectories with 84% improvement compared with baseline models. Our findings unveil that skilled and sophisticated movements are programmed through state-specific neural configurations.

              <div style="margin-top: 10px;">
                Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) establish direct communication pathways between the brain and external devices through safe, non-invasive neural sensing technologies, demonstrating significant potential in brain-computer interaction, mental state assessment, and intervention. Inspired by the technical roadmap of large language models, recent years have witnessed the emergence of large-scale foundation models for non-invasive BCIs. The core idea is to learn unified neural representations from multi-source brain data, thereby mitigating generalization challenges in brain state decoding caused by individual physiological differences, device heterogeneity, and environmental variability. This presentation will systematically introduce our preliminary explorations and practical progress in constructing large-scale foundation models for non-invasive BCIs, followed by an in-depth discussion of current core difficulties and key challenges for future development.              </div>
